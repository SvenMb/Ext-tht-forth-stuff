# forth-stuff
Misc Forth code for STM32 microcontrollers - applications and libraries. All the code depends on the JeeLabs libraries: http://embello.jeelabs.org/flib/

* `multiblink`: Simple example for the multitasker blinking two LEDs.

* `pumps`: Another multitasker example controlling two pumps depending on some water level sensors.

* `uart-recorder`: A tool to record UART communication (one-way). Playback-tool will follow.

* `ws2812b`: Library to control WS2812B LEDs using the SPI hardware and DMA.
